# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to Run the Rayda Application

The main branch of this application is the Master Branch,
To Download (or Clone) this application to your local computer, click on the `Code` button on Github and select either of the 
HTTPS, SSH or Github CLI options.

For HTTPS,
1. Copy the URL given (usually ends with .git).
2. Open `Git Bash` on your computer (To run Git-Bash, you'll need to install Git - see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git for more instructions).
3. In your `Git Bash` terminal, change the current directory to the location where your want the application to be cloned. 
4. Type in `git clone` paste the URL you copied earlier (See Step 1) - the application will be downloaded to your local computer.
5. Open the project in a Code Editor (I recommend VS Code) and open a new Terminal.
6. Type in `npm install` and press the `ENTER` key. It will install all the dependencies needed to run the application.
7. After Installation, on the terminal, type `npm start` and press "ENTER". The application should be launched on your browser.

For SSH,

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
